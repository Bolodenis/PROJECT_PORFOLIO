# Build your portfolio project (Week 2): MVP Complete
# Introduction
After experiencing long waits to place my order at restaurants, I decided to create an app/website that streamlines the entire process. Waiting for a customer to finish browsing the paper menu and then asking numerous questions about availability and preparation methods was frustrating. I wanted to enhance the dining experience by allowing users to easily browse a food catalog, view recipes, check food availability, and receive personalized dietary recommendations â€” all from the comfort of their seats. Additionally, the app will enable users to place orders and book hotel rooms seamlessly. This vision inspired my project.
